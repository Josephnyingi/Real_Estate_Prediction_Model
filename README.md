# Real_Estate_Prediction_Model
This repository contains a prediction model that can be used to accurately predict the sale price of houses given various predictor variables. Various regression models were tested after studying different factors that affect housing prices in the real estate industry. The models used in this analysis are multiple linear regression, quantile regression, ridge regression, lasso regression, and elastic net regression.
# Project description
Real estate also refers to producing, buying and selling real estate. As an investor in the real estate business, a company such as Hass Consulting, needs to be able to sell real estate properties at a price that is both profitable to them and attractive enough to the clients. While a low price might attract more customers, the company may experience low profit margin which can hinder growth. On the other hand, a high price may not bring in any customers therefore reducing the revenue stream.

Proper valuation of real estate is not only important for private businesses but also financial institutions such as banks. This is because banks often offer loans and mortgages to home owners, business or investors. When financial institutions do not price real estate appropriately, the negative effects in the economy could be dire. This was well demonstarated in the housing bubble burst during the 2008 financial crisis.

Various factors affect the price of any real estate property. Some of these factors include the square footage, number of rooms, location, year of construction and the nature of views and amenities available in the locale. This analysis seeks to study some of the mentioned variables and train a regression model that can the be used to predict the price of a house
# Technologies Used
